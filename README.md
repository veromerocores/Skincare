### Project Description

FroGa: Embrace Mindfulness with a Smile

Welcome to FroGa, a platform that embodies mindfulness, community, and purpose while radiating a lighthearted and humorous vibe. At FroGa, we believe in making mindfulness and yoga accessible to everyone, without barriers of cost or complexity. Our platform is dedicated to holistic well-being and self-discovery, inviting users to explore yoga and mindfulness practices with a smile.

Purpose and Philosophy
FroGa's essence is deeply rooted in the symbolism of the frog and its connection to the water element. Just like a frog gracefully moves between water and land, our platform encourages users to navigate the realms of mindfulness and self-discovery with ease. We believe that mental and physical well-being should be accessible to all, regardless of financial constraints or prior experience.

Core Values
Accessibility: We believe that anything beneficial for mental and physical health should be accessible for free. Our platform offers a wide range of resources and practices without requiring any sign-up or payment. As well as trying to provide the most accessible website possible to our means.

Community: FroGa fosters a sense of belonging and community among its users. Through shared experiences and support, we aim to create a supportive environment where individuals can embark on their journey of self-discovery together. This is why we implement a form in the about page, so people can feel connected to the community by sharing their experiences and concerns, or signing up for the newsletter that will keep them engaged with the community.

Playfulness: With our unique frog-inspired design and playful atmosphere, FroGa brings joy and lightness to the practice of mindfulness and yoga. We encourage users to approach their practice with curiosity, humor, and a sense of adventure.

Features
Free Resources: Access a diverse library of yoga poses with diverse levels of difficulty, a frog inspired session that you can follow at your own pase with our grid design, and keep your mind at ease with the random quotes our frog provides to you. Meditation page in the works!

Unique Frog Design: Our platform's distinctive frog design adds a touch of whimsy and charm, reinforcing our commitment to playful exploration and self-discovery.

No Sign-up Required: Enjoy seamless access to all features and resources without the hassle of creating an account or providing personal information.
